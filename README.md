# Chrome Extension for PriceChecker (BuyBook)
This a Vite + React project in typescript (for typescript intro see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

The extension also uses a service worker to handle long-running tasks like searching the web for alternative stores to find the products in a user's cart. see the worker.ts / worker.js file. 

The service worker file is not being bundled currenly so it is manually added to the public folder, when running the build step it will be added to the dist folder.  

#### To get started in development run:
```
  npm install
  npm run build
```

#### You will need to load the extension into your chrome browser:
1. go to chrome extensions
2. click on on load unpacked
3. select the project dist folder (the folder generated by the build step)\
4. extension should now be ready for use
5. note you should also have the backend node server running on localhost:3000

You can create an account by signing up, and start using the extension.
